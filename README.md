      o	Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
      o	The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
      o	The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school

The additional task is to replace the grades of Thomas High School of 9th graders to NaN for math and reading will keeping the rest of the data intact. This will repeat the school district analysis that was done and write a report to determine how these changes affected the overall analysis.
